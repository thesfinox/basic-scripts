## Introduction

This tools are a simple implementation of basic tasks we personally use in our desktop setup. They span across several applications, from using the terminal in a productive way to mounting hard drives and Android phones, etc.

The scripts are based on personal experience and may not provide a good user experience to everybody, but they will at least cover the basics for everyone.

## Documentation

You can find the full documentation in a nice [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) format [here](https://thesfinox.gitbook.io/basic-scripts/).
