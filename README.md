## Introduction

This tools are simple implementation of basic tasks we personally use in our desktop setup. They span across several applications, from using the terminal in a productive way to mounting hard drives and Android phones, etc.

The scripts are based on personal experience and may not provide a good user experience to everybody, but they will at least cover the basics for everyone.
