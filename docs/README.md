# Basic Tools and Scripts

## Introduction

![Basic tools, but no scripts](.gitbook/assets/safety_tools_1000v_vde-vde_electrician_sets-52_pcs.-52_pcs..png.jpg)

These tools are a simple implementation of basic tools to manage daily life tasks in a window manager such as i3. They span across several applications, from a productive use of the terminal to mounting hard drives and Android phones.

The scripts are based on personal experience and might not fit the exact needs of other users, but they will at least cover the basics for everyone.
