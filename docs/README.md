# Tools and Script

## Introduction

![Basic tools \(withouth scripts\)](.gitbook/assets/safety_tools_1000v_vde-vde_electrician_sets-52_pcs.-52_pcs..png.jpg)

This tools are a simple implementation of basic tasks we personally use in our desktop setup. They span across several applications, from using the terminal in a productive way to mounting hard drives and Android phones, etc.

The scripts are based on personal experience and may not provide a good user experience to everybody, but they will at least cover the basics for everyone.
